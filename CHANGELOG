* This is another test release, still not intended to be production-ready. Look for version 1.0. Almost there!!
* Updated to Ubuntu 8.04 "Hardy"
* Added new required option to :ec2onrails_config in deploy.rb: ec2onrails_config[:archive_to_bucket_subdir] is used by the ec2onrails:db:archive Capistrano task. See http://ec2onrails.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/documentation/examples/deploy.rb

* Bug fix: if :ec2onrails[:enable_ssl] = true the setup task fails due to /etc/init.d/apache2 not executable
* Bug fix: retry if needed on the first mysqld startup, because on first startup sometimes the /etc/init.d/mysql startup script thinks it failed because mysqld took too long to physically write the logs full.

* ami-b657b2df (32-bit) and ami-8957b2e0 (64-bit)

* First release built with new rake build script, this is a test release, not intended to be production-ready until it's tested more thoroughly.

They're needed only for registering a rebundled image so there's now a script to install them: /usr/local/ec2-on-rails/install_ec2_api_tools.sh. The ruby-based EC2 image tools are still installed.
* Removed "http://packages.ubuntu.com/feisty/libs/sun-java6-jre":Java and it's massive list of dependencies because it was only needed for the EC2 API tools. This saved a huge amount of space.
